# quosh
A browser extension for learning Marathi
Imp links:

(a) Grammarly
(b) jointoucan.com
(c) duolingo

We would like to build this for any and all languages in India, but learning from our previous project, we'd want to start with one and then replicate the same again.

This is why, currently the extension would serve the language learning needs of marathi lovers.
